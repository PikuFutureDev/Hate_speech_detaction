# Hate Speech Detection using python 📝

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect hate speech in text data. The core idea is to classify text into hateful or non-hateful categories, helping to build safer online platforms.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Classification using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
- Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step analysis

---

## 📂 Files
- `Hate_speech_detaction.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation).

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hate-speech-detection.git
    cd hate-speech-detection
    ```

2. Install required Python packages:
